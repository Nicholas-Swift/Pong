# Pong
My first official project - a simple Pong clone.

I have created many other game development projects, but this is my first, official, completed project. It's a simple Pong clone,
but I've added music, sound effects, and a menu with options. The project was made with C++ and SFML.

To download and play pong, simply download the repository and run Pong.exe. The exe will have to be placed with the .dll files
and the assets folder, the way it is structured in the repository.
