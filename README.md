# Pong
My first official project - an ultimate version of a classic game.

This is my first, official, completed project. It's a Pong clone, but I've added music, sound effects, and a menu with options. The project was made with C++ and SFML.

On this GitHub page, you can find my assets and my code. If you would like to download and play the game, please go to the link above at itch.io.
